# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn, a critical aspect for businesses, using Python. It aims to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition and develop a predictive model for churn.

## Technologies Used
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: Core programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)**: Employed for machine learning models and predictive analysis.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** and **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**: Utilized for data visualization.
- **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)**: Platform for code development, data exploration, and model building.

## Project Structure
- **Src**: Contains datasets used for analysis and prediction.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for preprocessing, model building, and prediction.
- **Results**: Includes model evaluation metrics, visualizations, and findings.
